  <li>Improved Defense: Ever since the tragic injury of Linebacker Ryan Shazier, Pittsburgh's Defense hasn't been the same. Other than Pro Bowl Corner Joe Haden, the secondary was atrocious. Artie Burns, a former first round pick, can't even cover Hellen Keller. 2018 First Round Pick Terrel Edmunds has gotten better, but last year he gave Steelers fans everywhere crippling anxiety. On top of this, Free Safety Sean Davis has a glass body. Defensive Coordinator is the only problem from last year as he has the IQ of a grapefruit. The Steelers got a solid corner in Steven Nelson in Free Agency to help out Haden. But the best acquisition is the trade for Minkah Fitzpatrick, a Safety that the Steelers tried getting in last years draft before settling for Edmunds. This young secondary is full of potential led by stud veteran Joe Haden. Linebacker TJ Watt is ready to take his next step into becoming a superstar. The best linebacker in this years draft, and the 10th overall pick from Michigan Devin Bush is a promising young talent. The D-line of All-Pro Cam Heyward, Stephon Tuitt, and Javon Hargrave has always been good, and the least of the Steelers' Defensive problems. If the D doesn't get it done this year, then Keith Butler should be on his way out. </li>
  <li>No First Round Pick: The Steelers lost Big Ben for the season to an elbow injury. This is one of the reasons why the Steelers playoff odds have plummeted. Many think that the Steelers would tank for a better draft pick, but by trading their first round pick for Minkah Fitz, the front office and Coach Mike Tomlin are showing they trust QB Mason Rudolph to replace Ben and lead this team to victory. This organization trusts Mason, and he has hardly been the problem so far. We have lost our two games wtih Rudolph by a combined total of 6.</li> 
  <li> Soft Division: The Steelers path to the playoffs may be easier than people think as the Bengals and Browns are both trash. "Boof" Baker Mayfield is extremely overrated. Mason Rudolph has a better QB Rating than him, and Bengals QB Andy Dalton. Andy Dalton couldn't throw at a still target to save his life. He is so bad I don't even know how he has a starting job. God he is just so bad. Anyways, Lamar Jackson is going off this year. He is actually throwing and can throw well. However, their defense lost like everything but they got Earl Thomas. The Ravens have the 2nd best coach, behind Tomlin, in the league. The other two are complete bots. The Ravens will fall once they play other good teams. So far they have played the Chiefs while the Steelers have played the Pats, Seahawks, and 49ers. Things will look up for Yinz soon. </ol>

  <p>Overall, with a weak division, and their easier games ahead, the Steelers will walk into the playoffs and easily play for a Super Bowl, where their young QB leads their strong Offense and powerful Defense to their 7th Super Bowl.</p>
